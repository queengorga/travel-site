                <h1>Experience Rome's Ancient History</h1>
                <p>In historiography, ancient Rome is Roman civilization from the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the 8th century
                BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, encompassing the Roman Kingdom (753 BC–509 BC),
                Roman Republic (509 BC–27 BC) and Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) until the fall of the western empire. The civilization
                began as an Italic settlement in the Italian Peninsula, conventionally founded in 753 BC, that grew into the city of
                Rome and which subsequently gave its name to the empire over which it ruled and to the widespread civilisation the
                empire developed. The Roman Empire expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world, though still
                ruled from the city, with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the
                time)) and covering 5.0 million square kilometres at its height in AD 117.><br>
                <p>In its many centuries of existence, the Roman state evolved from a elective monarchy to a democratic classical republic
                and then to an increasingly autocratic semi-elective military dictatorship of the empire. Through conquest, cultural,
                and linguistic assimilation, at its height it controlled the North African coast, Egypt, Southern Europe, and most of
                Western Europe, the Balkans, Crimea and much of the Middle East, including Levant and parts of Mesopotamia and Arabia.
                It is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece, and their similar cultures and societies are
                known as the Greco-Roman world.</p><br>
                <p>Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language, religion, society, technology, law, politics, government,
                warfare, art, literature, architecture and engineering. Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a
                system of government called res publica, the inspiration for modern republics[4][5][6] such as the United States and
                France. It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats, such as the construction of an extensive system of
                aqueducts and roads, as well as the construction of large monuments, palaces, and public facilities..</p><br>
                <p>The Punic Wars with Carthage were decisive in establishing Rome as a world power. In this series of wars Rome gained
                control of the strategic islands of Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily; took Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal); and
                destroyed the city of Carthage in 146 BC, giving Rome supremacy in the Mediterranean. By the end of the Republic (27
                BC), Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond: its domain extended from the Atlantic to Arabia
                and from the mouth of the Rhine to North Africa. The Roman Empire emerged with the end of the Republic and the
                dictatorship of Augustus Caesar. 721 years of Roman–Persian Wars started in 92 BC with their first war against Parthia.
                It would become the longest conflict in human history, and have major lasting effects and consequences for both empires.</p>

                    <h1>The Pantheon</h1>
                    <p>The Pantheon "[temple] of all the
                    gods") is a former Roman temple, now a church, in Rome, Italy, on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus
                    Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD). It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated
                    about 126 AD. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to
                    retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple, which had burned down.</p>
                    <p>It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings, in large part because it has been in continuous use
                    throughout its history and, since the 7th century, the Pantheon has been in use as a church dedicated to "St. Mary and
                    the Martyrs" (Latin: Sancta Maria ad Martyres) but informally known as "Santa Maria Rotonda". The square in front of
                    the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda. The Pantheon is a state property, managed by Italy's Ministry of Cultural
                    Heritage and Activities and Tourism through the Polo Museale del Lazio; in 2013 it was visited by over 6 million people. The Pantheon's large circular domed cella, with a conventional temple portico front, was unique in Roman architecture.
                    Nevertheless, it became a standard exemplar when classical styles were revived, and has been copied many times by later
                    architects.</p>

                    <h1>Trevi Fountain</h1>
                    <p>The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian
                    architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several others. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15
                    metres (161.3 ft) wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and the most famous fountain in the world. The
                    fountain has appeared in several notable films, including Roman Holiday, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, the eponymous
                    Three Coins in the Fountain, The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and Sabrina Goes to Rome.The fountain at the junction of three roads (tre vie)marks the terminal pointof the "modern" Acqua Vergine, the
                    revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a
                    virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some 13 km (8.1 mi) from the city. (This scene is presented on
                    the present fountain's façade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some 22 km (14 mi).
                    This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years.
                Coins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder. This was the theme of 1954's
                Three Coins in the Fountain and the Academy Award-winning song by that name which introduced the picture.</p>
