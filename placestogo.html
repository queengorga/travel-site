                    <h1>Palazzo Farnese</h1>
                    <p>Palazzo Farnese or Farnese Palace is one of the most important High Renaissance palaces in Rome. Owned by the Italian Republic, it was given to the French
                        government in 1936 for a period of 99 years, and currently serves as the French embassy in
                        Italy.First designed in 1517 for the Farnese family, the building expanded in size and conception
                            when Alessandro Farnese became Pope Paul III in 1534, to designs by Antonio da Sangallo the
                            Younger. Its building history involved some of the most prominent Italian architects of the
                            16th century, including Michelangelo, Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola and Giacomo della Porta.At
                            the end of the 16th century, the important fresco cycle of The Loves of the Gods in the
                            Farnese Gallery was carried out by the Bolognese painter Annibale Carracci, marking the
                            beginning of two divergent trends in painting during the 17th century, the Roman High
                            Baroque and Classicism.</p>

                    <h1>Palazzo Quirinale</h1>
                    <p>The Quirinal Palace (known in Italian as the Palazzo del Quirinale or simply Quirinale) is a historic building in Rome,
                    Italy, one of the three current official residences of the President of the Italian Republic, together with Villa
                    Rosebery in Naples and Tenuta di Castelporziano in Rome. It is located on the Quirinal Hill, the highest of the seven
                    hills of Rome in an area colloquially called Monte Cavallo. It has housed thirty Popes, four Kings of Italy and twelve
                    presidents of the Italian Republic.
                    
                    The Quirinal Palace was selected by Napoleon to be his residence par excellence as Emperor. However his permanence
                    never took place because of the French defeat in 1814 and the subsequent European Restoration.
                    
                    The palace extends for an area of 110,500 square metres and is the ninth-largest palace in the world in terms of area.</p>

                    <p>The Palazzo Colonna (Italian pronunciation: [paˈlattso koˈlɔnna]) is a palatial block of buildings in central Rome,
                    Italy, at the base of the Quirinal Hill, and adjacent to the church of Santi Apostoli. It is built in part over the
                    ruins of an old Roman serapeum, and it has belonged to the prominent Colonna family for over twenty generations.The first part of the palace dates from the 13th century, and tradition holds that the building hosted Dante during his
                    visit to Rome. The first documentary mention notes that the property hosted Cardinals Giovanni and Giacomo Colonna in
                    the 13th century. It was also home to Cardinal Oddone Colonna before he ascended to the papacy as Pope Martin V in 1417.In the 18th century, the long low facade designed by Nicola Michetti, with later additions by Paolo Posi with taller corner blocks (facing Piazza SS. Apostoli), was constructed and recalls earlier structures resembling a fortification.</p>

                    <h1>Vatican City State</h1>
                    <p>Vatican City, officially Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Città del
                    Vaticano; Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae), is an independent city-state enclaved within Rome, Italy.
                    Established with the Lateran Treaty (1929), it is distinct from yet under "full ownership, exclusive dominion, and
                    sovereign authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes). With an area of 44 hectares (110
                    acres), and a population of about 1,000, it is the smallest sovereign state in the world by both area and
                    population.The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the pope who
                    is the bishop of Rome and head of the Roman Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of
                    various national origins. Since the return of the popes from Avignon in 1377, they have generally resided at the
                    Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City.</p>

                    <h1>St. Peter's Basilica</h1>
                    <p>The Papal Basilica of St. Peter in the Vatican (Italian: Basilica Papale di San Pietro in Vaticano), or simply St.
                    Peter's Basilica (Latin: Basilica Sancti Petri), is an Italian Renaissance church in Vatican City, the papal enclavewithin the city of Rome.
                    Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world. While it is neither the mother
                    church of the Catholic Church nor the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome, St. Peter's is regarded as one of the holiest
                    Catholic shrines. It has been described as "holding a unique position in the Christian world" and as "the greatest of
                    all churches of Christendom". Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of St. Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the
                    first Bishop of Rome. St. Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica.</p>

                    <p>The Vatican Museums (Italian: Musei Vaticani; Latin: Musea Vaticana) are Christian and art museums located within the
                    city boundaries of the Vatican City. They display works from the immense collection amassed by popes throughout the
                    centuries including several of the most renowned Roman sculptures and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in
                    the world. The museums contain roughly 70,000 works, of which 20,000 are on display, and currently employ 640 people
                    who work in 40 different administrative, scholarly, and restoration departments. Pope Julius II founded the museums in the early 16th century. The Sistine Chapel, with its ceiling decorated by
                    Michelangelo and the Stanze di Raffaello decorated by Raphael, are on the visitor route through the Vatican Museums.In 2017, they were visited by 6 million people, which combined makes it the 4th most visited art museum in the world.</p>

                    <p>The Galleria Borghese (English: Borghese Gallery) is an art gallery in Rome, Italy, housed in the former Villa Borghese
                    Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery building was integrated with its gardens, but nowadays the Villa Borghese gardens
                    are considered a separate tourist attraction. The Galleria Borghese houses a substantial part of the Borghese collection
                    of paintings, sculpture and antiquities, begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope Paul V (reign
                    1605–1621). The Villa was built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese himself, who
                    used it as a villa suburbana, a country villa at the edge of Rome.Scipione Borghese was an early patron of Bernini and an avid collector of works by Caravaggio, who is well represented
                    in the collection by his Boy with a Basket of Fruit, St Jerome Writing, Sick Bacchus and others. </p>

                    <h1>Ara Pacis Augustae</h1>
                    <p>The Ara Pacis Augustae (Latin, "Altar of Augustan Peace"; commonly shortened to Ara Pacis) is an altar in Rome dedicated
                    to Pax, the Roman goddess of Peace. The monument was commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC to honor the
                    return of Augustus to Rome after three years in Hispania and Gaul, and consecrated on January 30, 9 BC.
                    Originally located on the northern outskirts of Rome, a Roman mile from the boundary of the pomerium on the west side of
                    the Via Flaminia,[4] it stood in the northeastern corner of the Campus Martius, the former flood plain of the Tiber
                    River and gradually became buried under 4 metres (13 ft) of silt deposits. It was reassembled in its current location,
                    now the Museum of the Ara Pacis, in 1938.Within the enclosing precinct walls, the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the lex aria, the law
                    governing the ritual performed at the altar.</p>

                    <p>The Mausoleum of Hadrian, usually known as Castel Sant'Angelo (Italian pronunciation: [kaˈstɛl sanˈtandʒelo]; English:
                    Castle of the Holy Angel), is a towering cylindrical building in Parco Adriano, Rome, Italy. It was initially
                    commissioned by the Roman Emperor Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself and his family. The building was later used by the
                    popes as a fortress and castle, and is now a museum. The structure was once the tallest building in Rome.
                The tomb of the Roman emperor Hadrian, also called Hadrian's mole, was erected on the right bank of the Tiber,
                between AD 134 and 139.Originally the mausoleum was a decorated cylinder, with a garden top and golden quadriga.
                Hadrian's ashes were placed here a year after his death in Baiae in 138, together with those of his wife Sabina, and his
                first adopted son, Lucius Aelius, who died in 138.  </p>
